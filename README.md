# SHA-1

My simple implementation of sha-1 to play with it, definitely runs slow

run with:

`python sha1.py hello`

`sha-1 digest: f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f`

Can also run files:

`python sha1.py myFile` \[this takes a while: ~3.3 seconds\]

`sha-1 digest: 34d96f7178fabb90309f4b21b734e663293744a7`
